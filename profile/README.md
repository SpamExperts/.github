# N-able Email Security

This is the home of [N-able](https://n-able.com)'s email security team. We have two products:

* [SpamExperts](https://spamexperts.com), offering incoming email filtering, outgoing email filtering & controls, and email archiving - tailored for web hosts and telcos.
* [Mail Assure](https://www.n-able.com/products/mail-assure), offering email protection and archiving - tailored for IT Professionals and MSPs. 

We've always been a big believer in open-source, and as well as releasing whatever we can here, we endeavour to contribute upstream to projects that we love and use as well.

## Projects we Love

* [Exim](https://github.com/exim)
* [Python](https://github.com/python)

## Public Repositories

The biggest group of repositories you'll find here are our integrations for various web hosting control panels, such as [cPanel](https://github.com/SpamExperts/cpanel-addon), [DirectAdmin](https://github.com/SpamExperts/directadmin-addon), [Plesk](https://github.com/SpamExperts/plesk-extension), [WHMCS](https://github.com/SpamExperts/whmcs-addon), [Zimbra](https://github.com/SpamExperts/zimbra-addon), and [CloudBlue](https://github.com/SpamExperts/aps2-addon).

We also have a few libraries that we use (particularly Python ones) that we felt might be of more general use.

[Pyzor](https://github.com/SpamExperts/pyzor) isn't a project we started, but one that we took up maintaining after the original developer retired. There's a lot we'd like to see happen here, but we're short on time at the moment. If you're interested in getting involved, we'd love to hear from you.

[OrangeAssassin](https://github.com/SpamExperts/OrangeAssassin) is a re-implementation of [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org) in Python. The original aim was to get improved performance (speed & memory usage) and to revitalise the rules approach (at the time the SpamAssassin project wasn't very active). This isn't a project that we're actively working on now, so if you'd be interested in taking a lead in future development, please reach out.

## Join us!

We're always hiring, in many locations around the world (the email security team is primarily located in Bucharest, Romania). Take a look at the [roles we currently have open](https://careers.n-able.com/) but if you don't find the perfect match and you know that you'd be a great fit with us, please also reach out to talk about possibilities.
